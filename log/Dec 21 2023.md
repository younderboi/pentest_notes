Can Clojure be hooked up to Burp suite somehow?
Please try to avoid going too deep on the clojure shit. Better finish the OSCP.
On the other hand there's a lot to learn by re-coding the exploits yourself.

What is the pros/cons of using babashka vs. clojure?
Would be nice with some middle ground...

Look into learning some C programming. Would be nice to mix the C code with a higher level language...
