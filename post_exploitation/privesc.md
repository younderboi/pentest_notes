1. Gather information about the system, such as OS version and configuration.
2. Explore the possibility of escalating privileges through user accounts.
3. Identify any commands that can be executed with sudo and check for any exploitable SUID binaries.
4. Look for writable files that can be modified to execute arbitrary commands.
5. Explore the possibility of opening shell sessions using tools like screen or tmux.


## System enumeration
1. Check for possible kernel exploits

Kernel information
```sh
uname -a
```

## User enumeration

1. Check if you are a member of any group that could grant you root privileges.
2. ...


Current user
```sh
whoami
```

User dump
```sh
cat /etc/passwd
```

Sudo priveliges
```sh
sudo -l
```

Check profile and shell history
```sh
cat ~/.bashrc
cat ~/bash_history
cat ~/bash_profile
```


## Process enumeration

1. Check for unknown software running on the system.
2. Identify any software running with higher privileges than it should have.
3. Search for exploits of running processes, especially the version running.
4. Look for opportunities to modify the binary of any running process.
5. Monitor processes and check for any interesting process running frequently.
6. Attempt to read interesting process memory where passwords could be saved.
7. Something about crontabs


Process dump
```sh
ps auxw
```

Cron dump
```sh
cat /etc/crontab
```

Processes listening on the network
```sh
netstat -an | grep LIST
```



## File enumeration





## `GTFPbins` and `LOLbins`

## Tools





## Unstructured notes

Have a look at `LinEnum.sh` for inspiration.
Look into `gtfobins`
